# Myanmar_Project
## Personal Project looking into the Myanmar Civil war

I begun the project by seeking already cleaned data relating to Myanmar, and started on the [humanitarian data exchange](https://data.humdata.org). There I found 3 clean datasets, looking at the POlitical casualties, Civilian casualties and Refugee locations globally.

I then went searching for some up to data economic data for Myanmar. This proved difficult, as there isn't much reporting coming out of the country. Eventually I was able to find data on Myanmar's exports at [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org). After looking through this, I proceeded just with the rare earth metal exports as the most interesting data.

From this initial data, I created a variety of graphs, including:

## Political and Civilian Casualties

## Global rare earth mining exports

## Refugee data for the region

## Aid comparison

# Dashboarding

I then gathered the graphs i had made and combined them into a dashboard visualisation, in order to complete the project, and highlight my data, its analysis and the final conclusions we could take away from my exploration of the data.
